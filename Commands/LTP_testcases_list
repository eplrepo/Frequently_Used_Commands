writetest -  verify integrity of disk writes.

The purpose of this test is to verify that writes to
 *                disk occur without corruption.  It writes one 1MB
 *                buffer at a time, where each byte in the buffer is
 *                generated from a random number.  Once done
 *                completed, the file is re-opened, the random number
 *                generator is re-seeded, and the file is verified.
